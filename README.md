# Clash Royale fake gem generator
A website imitating the fake "gem generator" for Clash Royale game, available open-source for everyone. Because why not?

## A brief description
Ever since, everyone wanted a legit way to get free gems - a premium in-game currency of Clash Royale game. Every generator utilizes a captcha system based on filling out exhausting forms requesting a lot of your personal data. This is the first CR gem generator not requesting such actions from you. Simply type your UID (could be found in your in-game profile info), type how much gems you want to get and click on "Generate". The generator will do its rest!

   <b>Every time you will try to "generate" free gems, you will encounter the holy Rickroll. No need to thank me.</b>

## Disclaimer
Note that no real Clash Royale API is in use, however originally I planned to use it for the only purpose of searching for a real player (although I had some problems while implementing Undici into that project, and even reinstalling packages given in the error log weren't giving an expected result due to the numerous errors with the access of NPM package manager to the Git repos - that error somehow disappeared when I excluded the broken package, however still nothing changed).
